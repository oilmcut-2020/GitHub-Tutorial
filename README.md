**Note** :GitHub will warn you if there are any duplicate entries i.e. if that username is already taken by some other individual
or not etc. Along with the error, GitHub will suggest you the available attributes also. For example, your username could be duplicate because whatever you are thinking as your username, might have been
already taken by someone else. 
In GitHub, you will be known by your username. So, it has to be unique. 

Once you press Sign up for GitHub button, you will be prompted to verify that you are not a robot.
Verify Account: "mail which is sent by github to your mail-id".

## Introduction to GitHub

GitHub is a file or code sharing service to collaborate with different people.GitHub is a highly used software which is typically used for version control. It is helpful when more than just one person is working on a project. Github helps them to build a centralized repository where everyone can upload, edit and manage the code files.
GitHub is a central repository and Git is a tool which allows you to create a local repository. Now people usually get confused between git and GitHub but its actually very different. Git is a version control tool that will allow you to perform all kinds of operations to fetch data from the central server or push data to it whereas GitHub is a core hosting platform for version control collaboration. GitHub is a company that allows you to host a central repository in a remote server.

## STEP 1: Creating a GitHub Repository
A repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a folder on your computer, or it can be a storage space on GitHub  or another online host. You can keep code files, text files, images or any kind of a file in a repository. You need a GitHub repository when you have done some changes and are ready to be uploaded. This GitHub repository acts as your remote repository. So let me make your task easy, just follow these simple steps to create a GitHub repository: 
- Go to the link: https://github.com/ . Fill the sign up form and click on “Sign up for Github” 
- Click on “Start a new project”.

Refer to the below screenshot to get a better understanding.

Enter any repository name and click on “Create Repository”. You can also give a description to your repository (optional).

Now, if you noticed by default a GitHub repository is public which means that anyone can view the contents of this repository whereas in a private repository, you can choose who can view the content. Also, private repository is a paid version. Also, if you refer the above screenshot, initialize the repository with a README file. This file contains the description of the file and once you check this box, this will be the first file inside your repository.
Congratulations, your repository is successfully created! It will look like the below screenshot:
