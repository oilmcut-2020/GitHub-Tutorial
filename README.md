**Note** :GitHub will warn you if there are any duplicate entries i.e. if that username is already taken by some other individual
or not etc. Along with the error, GitHub will suggest you the available attributes also. For example, your username could be duplicate because whatever you are thinking as your username, might have been
already taken by someone else. 
In GitHub, you will be known by your username. So, it has to be unique. 

Once you press Sign up for GitHub button, you will be prompted to verify that you are not a robot.
Verify Account: "mail which is sent by github to your mail-id".
